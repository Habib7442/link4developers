# Tailwind CSS Configuration Updates

## Required Breakpoint Utilities

To fully implement the responsive improvements, the following breakpoint utilities should be added to your Tailwind configuration:

### Breakpoint Extensions

Add these custom breakpoints to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        'xs': '475px',
        '3xl': '1600px',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Benefits of These Breakpoints

1. **xs (475px)**: 
   - Useful for very small mobile devices
   - Allows for more granular control on tiny screens
   - Helps with text truncation and spacing on small devices

2. **3xl (1600px)**:
   - Provides better control for large desktop screens
   - Allows for more content on ultra-wide displays
   - Useful for high-resolution monitor layouts

### Implementation Notes

- The `xs` breakpoint is used in the mobile header for the "Logout" button text
- These breakpoints help create a more fluid responsive design
- They complement the existing responsive utilities in the project
