**Project:** Link4Coders  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Owner:** Security & DevOps Team  
**Date:** August 2025

## 1. Purpose  
This document outlines the **security practices and policies** for Link4Coders to ensure:  
- Protection of user data (profiles, links, premium access, payment info).  
- Compliance with standard security practices.  
- Prevention, detection, and response to cybersecurity threats.  

---

## 2. Security Principles  
- **Confidentiality** ‚Äì User data must not be disclosed to unauthorized parties.  
- **Integrity** ‚Äì Data must remain accurate and tamper-proof.  
- **Availability** ‚Äì Services must remain accessible and resilient.  
- **Least Privilege** ‚Äì Access granted only when absolutely necessary.  
- **Zero Trust** ‚Äì Every request must be verified, regardless of source.

## 3. Data Security  
- [ ] All user data encrypted **in transit** (HTTPS/TLS 1.2+).  
- [ ] All sensitive data encrypted **at rest** (AES-256).  
- [ ] API keys, secrets, and environment variables stored in **vaults** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in code or repo.  
- [ ] Database access restricted to minimum required services.  

---

## 4. Authentication & Authorization  
- [ ] Support for **OAuth (GitHub, Google)** and **password-based auth**.  
- [ ] Strong password policies (min 8 chars, complexity required).  
- [ ] **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** available for users/admins.  
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) for admins, creators, and normal users.  
- [ ] Session tokens signed (JWT with short expiry + refresh tokens).  

---

## 5. Application Security  
- [ ] Regular **code reviews** with security in mind.  
- [ ] Run **static code analysis (SAST)** & **dependency scanning** (npm audit, GitHub Dependabot).  
- [ ] Validate and sanitize **all user inputs** to prevent XSS, SQL injection, CSRF.  
- [ ] Implement **rate limiting & CAPTCHA** for login/critical endpoints.  
- [ ] Use **Content Security Policy (CSP)** to block malicious scripts.  

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Network Security  
- [ ] Enforce **HTTPS everywhere** (HSTS enabled).  
- [ ] Use **firewalls & WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to block malicious traffic.  
- [ ] Regular **penetration testing** (quarterly).  
- [ ] Servers patched & updated regularly.  
- [ ] Separate staging, testing, and production environments.  
- [ ] Logs stored securely with monitoring enabled.  

---

## 7. Payments Security  
- [ ] All payments processed through **PCI-DSS compliant providers** (e.g., Stripe).  
- [ ] No raw credit card data stored in our systems.  
- [ ] Tokenized payment identifiers used instead of sensitive data.  

---

## 8. Monitoring & Incident Response  
- [ ] Real-time **monitoring & alerting** for suspicious activities.  
- [ ] Failed login attempts logged & monitored.  
- [ ] Incident response plan in place:  
  - Detection ‚Üí Containment ‚Üí Eradication ‚Üí Recovery ‚Üí Post-Mortem.  
- [ ] 24-hour SLA to report data breaches to stakeholders.  

---

## 9. Backup & Disaster Recovery  
- [ ] Automated **daily backups** of user data & configurations.  
- [ ] Backups encrypted & stored in **geo-redundant storage**.  
- [ ] Disaster recovery drills performed **quarterly**.  

---

## 10. Compliance & Privacy  
- [ ] GDPR / CCPA compliance for user rights (data deletion, export).  
- [ ] Clear **Privacy Policy** for data usage.  
- [ ] DPA (Data Processing Agreement) for enterprise customers.  
- [ ] Security training for developers and admins.  

---

## 11. Responsible Disclosure  
We encourage security researchers to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.  
- Email: `security@link4coders.com`  
- Response time: within **48 hours**.  
- Bounty program planned for verified vulnerabilities.  

---

## ‚úÖ Security Checklist  
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enabled  
- [ ] MFA available  
- [ ] Database encrypted  
- [ ] API keys in vaults  
- [ ] Dependencies scanned weekly  
- [ ] Penetration test scheduled  
- [ ] Incident response plan ready  
- [ ] Backups verified  
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance reviewed
